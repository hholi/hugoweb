# Fast publishing

This post is entered in a browser on my pad.  
Thanks to Hugo using Markdown to format posts I can preview the page before committing the changes.  
The purpose is to test *how easy* I can make new postings to my page.  
If auto deploy is working ok the page will be on the web right after I check this in to master.
